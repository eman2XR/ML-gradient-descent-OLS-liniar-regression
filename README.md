## Gradient Descent and OLS Example for Linear Regression
While taking the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng, I decided to try to implement some of the things I learnt inside Unity. This exmple was adapted from [The Coding Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Lsfu4ab74).

The example demonstrates how the [gradient descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) algorithm can be implemented in C# to solve a liniar equation problem. 
All the equations are visible in the inspector:
